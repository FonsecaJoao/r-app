### Setting Up a Project

Install project dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run the application:

Run `ng serve` or `ng serve --open` for a dev server, the last one opens a new tab ( or opens browser if wasn't previously opened) . Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
